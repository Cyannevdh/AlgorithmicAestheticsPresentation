# Algorithmic Aesthetics Presentation


# What is aethetics?

 - what things can have aesthetic value?
 - what are the ingredients of aesthetic value?
 - can aestethics be defined at all independent from individual perspective? which aspects are cultural/biological/universal?

# How can aesthetics be formalised?

 - 
 
 
 
# Simplicity correlates with Aesthetic Value

 - simplicity <=> complexity, can be mathematically formalised and measured by computers
 
 - the other way around: aesthetics as a principle in selecting theories and proving 
    => choice of theories or proofs done by aesthetic value when indistinguishable otherwise 
    => simple, and therefore more aesthetic objects/events/theories, are more likely according to most theories of complexity
    
 - connection between simplicity and likelihood connects neatly to theories about aesthetics based on predictability - that which is more easily
 predicted is judged to have higher aesthetic value (think about principles of symmetry, grouping, geometric shape)
